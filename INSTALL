;;; Installation:

;; 1. Copy vimpulse.el to somewhere in your load-path, e.g. your
;;    site-lisp directory.
;;
;; 2. Add the following block of code to your ~/.emacs file.  (If the
;;    file does not exist, create it.  If you use Windows, see
;;    http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html#TOC33 to
;;    learn where to save the file.  If you use a Mac, email
;;    implementations-list for help.)  Leave out the semicolons at the
;;    beginning of each line.
;;
;(setq viper-mode t)                ; enable Viper at load time
;(setq viper-ex-style-editing nil)  ; can backspace past start of insert / line
;(require 'viper)                   ; load Viper
;(setq vimpulse-experimental nil)   ; don't load bleeding edge code (see 6. installation instruction)
;(require 'vimpulse)                ; load Vimpulse
;(setq woman-use-own-frame nil)     ; don't create new frame for manpages
;(setq woman-use-topic-at-point t)  ; don't prompt upon K key (manpage display)
;;
;; 3. Optional:  If you use GNU Emacs and want C-r (the redo key) to work,
;;    also install http://wonderworks.com/download/redo.el
;;    and add (require 'redo) to your .emacs file.  (XEmacs and
;;    Aquamacs already ship redo.el.)
;;
;; 4. Optional:  If you want a nice-looking block visual mode (i.e.
;;    rectangle selection), download and install
;;    http://emacswiki.org/elisp/download/rect-mark.el
;;    and add (require 'rect-mark) to your .emacs file.
;;    Block mode will work without rect-mark but you won't see the
;;    nice rectangle.
;;
;; 5. Optional:  If you don't want to use the enhanced paren-matching
;;    algorithm, add
;;         (setq vimpulse-enhanced-paren-matching nil)
;;    to your .emacs _before_ (require 'vimpulse).
;;
;; 6. Optional:  If you want to use experimental features, remove
;;    (setq vimpulse-experimental nil) from your .emacs before
;;    loading vimpulse.
;;
;; We would appreciate it if you emailed us saying whether you liked
;; or disliked vimpulse and why, and which new features you would like.
;; Also, if you stop using Emacs or Vimpulse, please tell  us why so
;; that we can try to improve them.
