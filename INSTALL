;;; Installation:

;; If you checked out from Git, do `make all' to produce
;; vimpulse-big.el.  If on Windows, you can run compile.bat.  Then:
;;
;; 1. Copy vimpulse.el (or vimpulse-big.el) to somewhere in your
;;    load-path, e.g., your site-lisp directory.
;;
;; 2. Comment out and add the following line to your .emacs file:
;;
;;        (require 'vimpulse)
;;
;;    If .emacs does not exist, create it.  If you use Windows,
;;    see http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/faq3.html.
;;
;; That's all the required steps.  The rest is optional:
;;
;; 3. If using GNU Emacs, download and install
;;    http://wonderworks.com/download/redo.el to get C-r
;;    (redo key) to work.  redo.el is included with XEmacs.
;;
;; Vimpulse automatically enables Viper.  You can temporarily disable
;; Viper (and Vimpulse) with the C-z key.
