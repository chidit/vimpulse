;;; Usage:

;; To use Visual mode, press v in vi (command) mode. Then use the
;; motion commands to select the region.  Press d to delete, c to
;; change, r to replace, or y to copy.  You can use p to paste. For
;; line selection, press V instead of v.  Then you can copy and paste
;; whole lines.  For block selection, press C-v.  Now you can copy and
;; paste the selected rectangle.  In block selection, you may use I or
;; A to insert or append text before or after the selection on each
;; line.
;;
;; Other features:
;;
;; The extended documentation is still in its early stages, but you
;; can view drafts at
;;
;; http://my-trac.assembla.com/vimpulse/wiki/Documentation
;;
;; Also see the definition of `viper-vi-global-user-map' right near
;; the beginning of the code.  You'll see a list of keys and what
;; function each one calls.  The documentation that comes with Vim
;; -- which is also online at http://vimdoc.sf.net/ -- may also be
;; helpful.
;;
;; Tips:
;;
;; - Vimpulse makes C-r run `redo' in command mode, but you can
;;   still get reverse i-search by pressing C-s and then C-r.
