;;  DISCLAIMER: I took on the maintainership because I've seen the script is
;;              currently unmaintained, and I just woke up 2 days ago, installed 
;;              emacs again, installed vimpulse and noticed visual mode sucked big
;;              time, so I implemented a visual mode and a paren match algorithm
;;              to make vimpulse better. But:
;;                 A) I suck big time as a maintainer
;;                 B) I'm very lazy
;;                 C) I'm even more lazy
;;             But still it's better then no maintainer at all I think. Anyone wanting
;;             to volunteer for maintainership please email me :)

;; Note: If you create a patch that makes Vimpulse work more 
;;       like Vim, do not send it to the maintainer.  Test it on Emacs 
;;       and XEmacs, then merge it into the wiki page.  Send all other 
;;       patches to the maintainer.

;;; Commentary:

;; Vimpulse emulates Vim's most useful features, including Visual
;; mode and (still partially) text objects.  
;; Vimpulse is a set of modifications to viper, the minor mode
;; that emulates Vi.  Vimpulse is not a minor mode; as soon as it is
;; loaded, viper will start working in a more Vim-like way.
;; NEWS 19/06/2009: The visual mode is greatly improved, we also 
;;                  feature an improved paren matching. It can
;;                  become slow (i didn't check, but it's likely)
;;                  if you work with very big files, so deactivate it 
;;                  if you notice sluggishness (see point 5 of the 
;;                  installation instructions). 
;; 
;; Vimpulse is beta software.  It seems to work quite well already
;; though.  Patches and feature requests welcome.
