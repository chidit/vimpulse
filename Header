;;; Commentary:

;; Vimpulse emulates Vim's most useful features, including Visual mode
;; and text objects.  Vimpulse is a set of modifications to Viper, the
;; minor mode that emulates vi.  Vimpulse is not a minor mode; as soon
;; as it is loaded, Viper will start working in a more Vim-like way.
;;
;; Vimpulse is beta software.  It seems to work quite well with
;; GNU Emacs 22.3 and 23.1.  There are some problems with Undo in
;; XEmacs 21.4.22.  Please send us compatibility info about other
;; versions.
;;
;; Patches and feature requests are welcome.
