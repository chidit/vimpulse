;;; Commentary:

;; Vimpulse emulates Vim's most useful features, including Visual
;; mode and (still partially) text objects.
;; Vimpulse is a set of modifications to viper, the minor mode
;; that emulates Vi.  Vimpulse is not a minor mode; as soon as it is
;; loaded, viper will start working in a more Vim-like way.
;;
;; Vimpulse is beta software.  It seems to work quite well already
;; though.  Patches and feature requests welcome.
;;
;; NEWS 19/06/2009: The visual mode is greatly improved, we also
;;                  feature an improved paren matching. It can
;;                  become slow (i didn't check, but it's likely)
;;                  if you work with very big files, so deactivate it
;;                  if you notice sluggishness (see point 5 of the
;;                  installation instructions).
