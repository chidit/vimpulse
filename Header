;;; Commentary:

;; Vimpulse emulates Vim's most useful features, including Visual mode
;; and text objects. Vimpulse is a set of modifications to Viper, the
;; minor mode that emulates vi. Vimpulse is not a minor mode; as soon
;; as it is loaded, Viper will start working in a more Vim-like way.
;;
;; Vimpulse is beta software.  It seems to work quite well already,
;; though.  Patches and feature requests are welcome.
