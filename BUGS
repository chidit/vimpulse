;; Known bugs:
;;
;; - cw with a count doesn't work the same as Vim when the point
;;   is just before a space between words
;;     - Fix plan: try cw with a count, then try dwi with a count; or,
;;       ask on a relevant forum how the commands differ; or, check
;;       how it works in Vi / Vim then check the Vim manual for more
;;       info; then, decide how to best fix.
;;         - Vim's behavior seems unconsistent in this case.
;;           I think making the fix optional would be best, as I (at least)
;;           like more vimpulse behavior in this case (defaulting to
;;           standard vim behavior though)
;;
;; - Undo has problems in XEmacs.
